/// Removes liquidity from a position in an Orca liquidity pool and closes it, managing funds via Tuna's smart contract.
///
/// This function uses the SOL/USDC Whirlpool with preset withdrawal amounts and swap options. These presets can be adjusted or passed through the functionâ€™s input.
///
/// **Note:** This function combines opening and removing liquidity, though these actions can be performed separately. Liquidity can be removed multiple times based on the available liquidity in the Orca position.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `rpc`: The `RpcClient` for interacting with the Solana blockchain.
/// - `authority`: The authority `Signer` who owns the position.
/// - `tuna_position_mint`: The `Pubkey` of the Tuna Position Mint identifying the position to manage.
///
/// # Returns
/// - `Result<()>`: Returns `Ok(())` if the transaction is successful, or an error if it fails.
